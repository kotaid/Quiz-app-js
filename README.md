it may not function so well, didn't put so much work in it, but the idea is to choose one div and put the correct answer in it, and just make the flex order random, without having to check for the answer is it correct or not, if the div is the one holding the correct one you score, if you don't score...

just liked to run from complexity and use only flex order to do the job.
